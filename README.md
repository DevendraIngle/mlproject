### End to End Machine Learning Project
# Student Performance ML Prediction

## Overview
The **Student Performance ML Prediction** project predicts the mathematics score of students based on several factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation status, and scores in writing and reading exams.

This machine learning model uses regression techniques to predict a student's performance in mathematics, helping to understand the impact of various factors on academic performance.

## Features

- **Gender**: The gender of the student (male/female).
- **Ethnicity**: The ethnic group the student belongs to (Group A, B, C, D, E).
- **Parental Education Level**: The highest education level attained by the student's parents.
- **Lunch Type**: Whether the student receives a free/reduced or standard lunch.
- **Test Preparation Course**: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.
- **Writing and Reading Scores**: The student's scores out of 100 in writing and reading.

## How It Works

1. The user provides inputs on the factors mentioned above.
2. The model processes the data and predicts the student's mathematics score.
3. The predicted score is then displayed on the web page for the user.
